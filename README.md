🚀 I'm a full-stack engineer with experience in Web, software, and iOS development. I have previously developed projects at Deloitte, Liberty Mutual, and the Wharton School. 🛠️

🎓 I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania (graduating in May 2025), to further solid my foundation in database, data structures and software design. 👩🏻‍💻

🎨 Besides Computer Science, I a;sp have an interdisciplinary background in media art. I'm on my journey to become a creative developer who can engage art and technology. ✨

⚙️ I love brainstorming and developing apps that apply the latest technologies to solve practical problems in daily life, which brings me a great satisfaction. 💕

🍏 When not working, I'm a big outdoors enthusiast. I love climbing, hiking, and visiting a lot of mountains! 🏔️
